**NOTES**
- I was unable to find a comic with a non-empty description value.
- For the sake of time, I did not mock the UI tests.
- Unit tests are currently mocked.
- Ask me for the private key to test
- No third party libraries used but would potentially use https://wiremock.org/ for automation testing
